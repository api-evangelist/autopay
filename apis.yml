  Autopay is a convenient service that allows individuals to set up automatic
  payments for their bills and expenses. By securely linking their bank account
  or credit card to Autopay, users can schedule recurring payments for things
  like utilities, rent, loan payments, and subscription services. This
  eliminates the need to manually make payments each month, saving time and
  ensuring that bills are always paid on time. Autopay helps individuals stay
  organized and on top of their finances, offering peace of mind knowing that
  their payments are being taken care of automatically.
